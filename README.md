# The Gipherator

### Overview

The Chad and I have created a GIF generator app where visiters can come come and view the GIFs that have been added to the database. Registered users can see those GIFs as well and add favorites to their own page. Admins can interact with the Giphy API to add new GIFs to the database. 

We launched it up to heroku and you can view it right here.
